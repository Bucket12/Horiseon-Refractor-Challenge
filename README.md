# Refractor Challenge 1

## Description

The purpose of this project was to help Horiseon with their accessibilty on their webpage. Accessibilty is an important feature of any website as not everyone may be able to read for what ever reason that may be. This allows for mre users to have more access to Horiseon's website. The HTML created here cleaned up the initial code and made it sematically appealing by consolidating code and deleting code that may have been repetitious or of no use. I learned that code does not have to messy and all over the place. Code can be organized in a way that allows easy reading and easy editing.
